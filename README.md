The purpose of this application is to manage userâ€™s daily life expenses. In our daily life, we do many expenses and as we know it is a hectic task to remember all the expenses. Moreover, those people who live with their friends or relatives and make their expenses collectively then it is difficult for them to remember that who owes who and for what. To solve this problem, we developed this application that helps the user to manage his expenses. In this application, user can make group of friends or single person group. And whenever he makes some expense, he can divide that expense amount among his group friends. In this way, he can see all his expenses in each group or individual. And also, he can check that how much money their friends have to give him.
